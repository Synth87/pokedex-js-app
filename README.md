# JavaScript Pok√©dex-App

## Description of the project

I am building a small **web application** with _HTML, CSS_ and _JavaScript_ that loads
data from an **external API** and enables the viewing of data points in detail. The contents of the Pokedex are used as an example.

## Key Features

- Load data from an external source (API)
- View a list of items
- On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item and display them in a modal

## List of technologies that will be used in this project

- HTML, CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Bootstrap

The project is currently in progress.
